     I am a student at 'The College' of Charleston persuing a B.S. in <strong>Biology</strong>
     as well as <strong>Exercise Science</strong>. I recently completed the <strong>Impact X</strong>
     program through my school, which allowed me to cofound Connect 17 and Life Launcher. As I finish
     out my final year at The College, I am continuing to take courses outside of my school to become
     fluent in a few programing languages: Swift, HTML5, CSS, and Java. As different as these studies
     may seem, I plan to continue my education with an M.S. in Computer Science; my aspiration is to
     work with companies to use modern technologies that will drive environmental change much more
     efficiently than the current models being used today.
